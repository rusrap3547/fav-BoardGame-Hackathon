A lot of times I dont like the thought of people worried about where I learn something, I pick up inforamtion quickly. But I wanted to cite my sources anyways. They are not official but its how I got the information.

A lot of the ideas are from the concept of the card game "War". Very simply, is X greater than Y = which is a boolean, 

Boolean = True, then Player wins.
Boolean = False, then Enemy wins.

Programming logic is really fun and it always comes down to a yes or no. Anything else is too much detail for a computer.

First we'll cite the obvious: 
W3schools (What is a document page is how I built most of this)
Mozzilla Development Network
Devslopes Mentors. (major help)

Second I'll start going through the less obvious.
Youtube, a lot of videos on how to build a game and logic of making something visual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcJtWF4p-1U&ab_channel=RobertHewlett

This video in particular I want to mention becuase it taught me the ways of building a custom selector and other functions that are needed.
His channel was invaluable to me, and the fact that he doesn't have more than 500 subscribers is a crime. I made sure he had one more.

next is the ability to create or rather use html that is within an element with what I think is DOM manipulation. 
I have a video from Jon higger from a while back that showed me about DOM manipulation which gave me the idea to look up the JS "Element"
That video also explained a key on the keyboard I had never used before, the Tilde, or squiggle next to Escape

I'm pretty excited to say this is the inspiration for the combat popup that I hope will work as I see it.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML - this also helped going through each property

creating the movement was the hardest part so I just started with google. 
"how do you create a variable to wait for assign it a value"

Luckily I found this stackoverflow article.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3635924/how-can-i-make-a-program-wait-for-a-variable-change-in-javascript

I also looked up how do you change something inside an html character, afterwards I found the .appendChild method, its used to
make changes inside the html that is within the () of the method. This is different than the Node.append which is its own command.
